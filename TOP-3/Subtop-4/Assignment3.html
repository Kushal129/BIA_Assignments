Discuss the authentication mechanisms provided by NTLM (NT LAN Manager) and Kerberos in Windows environments. Explain the process of user authentication and authorization in NTLM and Kerberos. Compare the security features and vulnerabilities of NTLM and Kerberos authentication protocols, considering factors such as cryptographic strength, susceptibility to relay attacks, and support for single sign-on (SSO). Evaluate the implications of selecting NTLM or Kerberos for authentication in Windows-based networks, considering security, performance, and compatibility requirements.
