                    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. Significance of SAM Files and System Files</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">In Windows environments, SAM (Security Accounts Manager) files and system files play
                        critical roles in user authentication and system configuration:</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">SAM Files</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">The SAM file, located at <code>C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM</code>, stores user
                        account information and hashed passwords. This file is crucial for user authentication because
                        it verifies credentials during the login process. It is protected by the system to prevent
                        unauthorized access, but if compromised, it can be a significant security risk.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">System Files</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">System files, like <code>System32</code> and <code>Windows</code> configuration
                        files, contain critical information about the operating system's configuration and state. They
                        are essential for system stability and configuration, affecting how the OS manages hardware and
                        software resources.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Password Hashing in Windows</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">Windows uses password hashing to securely store user passwords. The process involves
                        converting plain-text passwords into hashed values using cryptographic algorithms:</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Hashing Process</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">When a user sets or changes their password, Windows hashes it using a cryptographic
                        algorithm and stores the hash in the SAM file. During login, the entered password is hashed
                        again, and the resulting hash is compared with the stored hash to verify the user's credentials.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Cryptographic Algorithms</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Windows primarily uses the following hashing algorithms:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>NTLM (NT LAN Manager):</strong> An older hashing algorithm that uses a combination
                            of MD4 and DES encryption. It is considered weak due to vulnerabilities and has been largely
                            replaced by more secure methods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kerberos:</strong> A more secure authentication protocol that uses tickets and
                            strong encryption methods, including AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). It is the preferred
                            method for modern Windows environments due to its improved security features.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Evaluating Password Hashing Techniques</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">Each password hashing technique has its strengths and weaknesses:</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Strengths</h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>NTLM:</strong> Provides a basic level of security and is compatible with older
                            systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kerberos:</strong> Offers robust security through strong encryption, mitigates
                            replay attacks, and is suitable for modern enterprise environments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Weaknesses</h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>NTLM:</strong> Vulnerable to various attacks, such as pass-the-hash and brute-force
                            attacks. It is less secure compared to newer methods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kerberos:</strong> Requires careful implementation and configuration to avoid
                            potential security issues, such as ticket manipulation and key distribution problems.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. Enhancing Password Security</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">To enhance password security and mitigate attacks, consider the following measures:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Enforce password complexity requirements, such as a
                            mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, to reduce vulnerability to attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Add an additional layer of
                            security by requiring a second form of authentication, such as a mobile app or hardware
                            token.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regularly Update Password Hashing Algorithms:</strong> Transition to more secure
                            hashing algorithms and authentication protocols as they become available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor and Audit Access:</strong> Regularly review and audit user accounts and
                            access logs to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Educate Users:</strong> Provide training on recognizing phishing attempts and using
                            secure passwords to prevent social engineering attacks.</li>
                    </ul>
