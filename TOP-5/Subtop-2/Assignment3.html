                    <p class="text-base">
                        <strong>Port scanning</strong> is a fundamental method used in network security assessments to
                        detect open ports, identify services, and map the structure of a network. It's an essential part
                        of vulnerability management because identifying which ports are open helps to understand where
                        potential security risks might exist.

                        The main objectives of port scanning include:

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                        <li><strong>Detecting Open Ports:</strong> By scanning, you can discover which ports are
                            open and accessible from the internet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identifying Services:</strong> Each open port may be running a specific service
                            (like HTTP or FTP), and scanning helps identify which services are active.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mapping Network Topologies:</strong> Port scanning can also reveal how the network
                            is structured, providing insights into potential attack surfaces.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Common Port Scanning Techniques:</h2>
                    <p class="text-base">
                        There are different methods of port scanning, each with its advantages and limitations. Here’s a
                        breakdown of three common techniques:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                        <li><strong>TCP SYN Scanning:</strong> This is a stealthier method where the scanner sends a SYN
                            (synchronize) packet to a port. If a SYN-ACK is received, the port is considered open. This
                            technique is less likely to be logged by firewalls.</li>
                        <li><strong>TCP Connect Scanning:</strong> This method completes the TCP handshake with the
                            target port. While more reliable, it is easier to detect by security systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>UDP Scanning:</strong> This technique scans for open UDP ports. Since UDP is
                            connectionless, it can be slower and more difficult to perform, but it’s essential for
                            finding services like DNS or SNMP running on UDP.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Example: TCP SYN Scan using <code>nmap</code></h2>
                    <p class="text-base">
                        A simple example of TCP SYN scanning using <strong>nmap</strong> is shown below. This scan
                        attempts to detect open ports on a target machine:
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-sm">
                        <strong>Example Command (SYN Scan):</strong>
                        <pre><code>nmap -sS <target-ip></code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-base">
                        The <code>-sS</code> option tells <strong>nmap</strong> to perform a SYN scan. This type of scan
                        is often used because it's fast and can be less noticeable to security systems.

                    <p class="text-base">
                        Each type of port scan has its own pros and cons:

                        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Port scanning helps you discover potential vulnerabilities,

                        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Some scans, like UDP scans, can be slow or inefficient, and
                            advanced firewalls may block or log your scan attempts.</li>

                        While port scanning is essential for network security assessments, it's crucial to conduct it
                        ethically and within legal boundaries:

                        <li><strong>Responsible Use:</strong> Only perform scans on networks or systems you have
                            explicit permission to assess. Scanning without permission is illegal and unethical.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respecting Privacy:</strong> Follow ethical hacking principles, such as those
